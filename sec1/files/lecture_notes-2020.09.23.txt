referential integrity
 - system of checks and balances

rdbms theory- rules of normalization (added referential integrity).

primary key - is a column in a db with a unique value for each row. it identifies each row and a unique entity.

a thing with distinct and independent existence.

all columns in the table (entity) are dependent on primary key.

implementation - constraint - limiting factor - rule that ensure every value in that column is  unique.

foreign key - another constraint - that limits changes (updates and deletes)
	like in customer table
	customer id 
	product id

in a db - a rowid is an internal construct to uniquely identify each row in db for system use (whether it has pk or not - does not matter)
