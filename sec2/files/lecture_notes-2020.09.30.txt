set theory - union and intersection
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory

select empno, ename, sal
from emp
where job='CLERK';

select count(*) 
from emp;
select count(*) 
from dept;

select empno, ename, sal, dname
from emp, dept;
cartesian product.

please study  basic concepts and notation on set theory.

writing conditions - 
	if I get an A in SQL and an F in Java then I am ....
	and 
	if I get an A in SQL or an F in Java then I am ....
	or

3 datatypes - 
number
char or varchar2 
date

char is a fixed length string
bob_ _ _ _ _ _ _
varchar2 is variable length string.
bob

comparing strings in SQL .. trim the strings.

select ename, trim(ename)
from emp;


update emp 
set sal = 99999
where ename = 'SCOTT';


select ename, sal, comm, sal+comm, sal+1000000
from emp;

update emp 
set sal = 99999
where ename = 'SCOTT';


select ename
from emp
where sal <> 1250
order by 1;

select ename, sal, comm
from emp
where comm = null;

select ename, sal, comm
from emp
where comm is null;

select ename, sal, comm
from emp
where comm is not null;

select sal "Salaru"
from emp;

select ename
from emp
where ename like 'J%';


select ename
from emp
where trim(ename) like '%S';

select ename
from emp
where trim(ename) like '%LL%';
