Dean of Admission at DeAnza College has hired you to do the database design for a new registration system. Keeping in the mind the following requirements, design a Database Schema. 
1. College has several departments 
2. Department offer several courses 
3. Courses have sections. 
4. College has locations (Room Sem 5 etc.) 
5. Students register for a section from a catalog (which is composed of Departments, Courses, Sections, Location.) 
6. Students have to pay for the course they take. You may want to think about resident, non resident. 
7. Their status is updated based on their registration. 
A document to help you remind the symbols for DB Schema is posted in the notes area for Session 1 - called "Introduction to RDBMS.doc".
