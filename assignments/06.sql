/*
Dean of Admission at DeAnza College has hired you to do the database design for
a new registration system. Keeping in the mind the following requirements,
design a Database Schema.
*/
5.
Students register for a section from a catalog (which is composed of
Departments, Courses, Sections, Location.)

6.
Students have to pay for the course they take. You may want to think about
resident, non resident.

7.
Their status is updated based on their registration. A document to help you
remind the symbols for DB Schema is posted in the notes area for Session 1 -
called Introduction to RDBMS.doc.
